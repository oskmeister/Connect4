Connect-4
Written by Oskar Werkelin Ahlin.

A simple Connect-4 game, with an AI player implemented using a twist of alpha-beta pruning. It beat the Ubuntu built-in Connect-4 on hardest level on first attempt.

Usage:

make, then run with ./Connect4. Edit GameHandler.cc for switching between human player / AI player.
